Strapi is a free and open source headless CMS delivering your content anywhere you need.

- **Keep control over your data**. With Strapi, you know where your data is stored, and you keep full control at all times.
- **Self hosted**. You can host and scale Strapi projects the way you want. You can choose any hosting platform you want: AWS, Netlify, Heroku, a VPS, or a dedicated server. You can scale as you grow, 100% independent.
- **Database agnostic**. You can choose the database you prefer. Strapi works with SQL & NoSQL databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.
- **Customizable**. You can quickly build your logic by fully customizing APIs, routes, or plugins to fit your needs perfectly.

## Getting Started

<a href="https://strapi.io/documentation/3.0.0-beta.x/getting-started/quick-start.html" target="_blank">Read the Getting Started tutorial</a> or follow the steps below:

### ‚è≥ Installation

Install Strapi with this **Quickstart** command to create a Strapi project instantly:

- (Use **yarn** to install the Strapi project (recommended). [Install yarn with these docs](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).)

```bash
yarn create strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```

**or**

- (Use npm/npx to install the Strapi project.)

```bash
npx create-strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```

This command generates a brand new project with the default features (authentication, permissions, content management, content type builder & file upload). The **Quickstart** command installs Strapi using a **SQLite** database which is used for prototyping in development.

Enjoy üéâ

### Try on Heroku

You can also give it a try using Heroku in one click!

<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/strapi/strapi-heroku-app">
  <img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy">
</a>

Be aware that the Content Type Builder won't work due to the restriction of writing files on the Heroku servers. If you would like to change/edit/add Content Types, you need to follow these steps:

1. Click the button above and deploy your app
2. Clone that repo by using `heroku git:clone -a` followed by your repo's name
3. Go into the cloned projects' folder using `cd` followed by your repo's name
4. Add the Heroku boilerplate as a remote by running `git remote add boilerplate https://github.com/strapi/strapi-heroku-app`
5. Pull from this new origin by running `git pull boilerplate master`
